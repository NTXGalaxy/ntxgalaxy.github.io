You can send common image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP. The bot will process these and try to extract text.

### Is there a limit on image size?

Yes, while there is no strict limit, smaller images will generally yield better results. If the image is too large, processing may fail.

### Can I use multiple images at once?
